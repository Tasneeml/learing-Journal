# Introduction:

#  how JavaScript can be used in browsers to make websites more interactive, interesting, and user-friendly. You will also learn about jQuery because it makes writing JavaScript a lot easier.

## you will need to know how to build web pages using HTML and CSS :
1.	Understanding some basic programming concepts and the terms that JavaScript programmers use to describe them.
1.	Learning the language itsel
1.	Becoming familiar with how it is applied by looking at examples

# You might not want to force visitors to reload the content of an entire web page, Just reloading a section of the page can make a site feel like it is faster to load and more like an application.

## how to read and write the JavaScript language itself:

*What is a script and how do I How create one ?  
*How do I write a script for web page? 

## In this book, we are focussing on the JavaScript language and how it is used in web browsers. 
Just like learning any new language, you need to get to grips with the: 
• Vocabulary: The words that computers understand 
• Syntax: How you put those words together to create instructions computers can follow

**A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal.** 
**Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions.** 
**Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task prggrammatically.** 
**To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task**

# expression:

**expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions**

1.EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE 

1.EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE

# OPERATORS :
they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values. 

# ARITHMETIC OPERATORS: 
*JavaScript contains the following mathematical operators, which you can use with numbers. You may remember some from math class.*

# STRING OPERATOR :
*There is just one string operator: the+ symbol. It is used to join the strings on either side of it.*

# Functions:

**Browsers require very detailed instructions about what we want them to do.**

This chapter is divided into three sections:
 
*FUNCTIONS 
*OBJECTS 
*BUILT-IN METHODS OBJECTS 

## WHAT IS A FUNCTION? 
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function
